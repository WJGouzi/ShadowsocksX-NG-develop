# ShadowsocksX-NG

Current version is 1.5

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shadowsocks/ShadowsocksX-NG.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/shadowsocks/ShadowsocksX-NG)

Next Generation of [ShadowsocksX](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-iOS)

## Why?

It's hard to maintain the original implementation as there is too much unused code in it.
It also embeds the ss-local source. It's crazy to maintain dependencies of ss-local.
So it's hard to update the ss-local version.

Now I just copied the ss-local from homebrew. Run ss-local executable as a Launch Agent in the background.
Serve PAC js file as a file URL. So there is only some source code related to GUI left.
Then I will rewrite the GUI code in Swift.

## Requirements

### Running

- Mac OS X 10.11 +

### Building

- XCode 8.3+
- cocoapod 1.2+

## Different from orignal ShadowsocksX

Run ss-local as a background service through launchd, not as an in-app process.
So after you quit the app, the ss-local maybe be still running.

Added a manual mode which won't configure the system proxy settings.
Then you could configure your apps to use socks5 proxy manual.
